        <p>If you enjoy hiking, taking a hiking tour to the famous mountains in Kenya would serve you best. Most national parks in Kenya and in neighboring Tanzania are very expensive, but the national parks in Kenya do not require a guide when hiking, unlike parks in Tanzania. This makes a huge difference in the cost for those who are budget conscience. Hiking the tallest mountain in Africa is impressive, but you’ll need a guide to tackle Mount Kilimanjaro.

          A hike up Mount Kenya is actually more challenging and many think it’s a more beautiful and dramatic mountain. And it is MUCH cheaper to climb. Hiking in Africa comes with a cost and climbing Mount Kenya is a great alternative to Kilimanjaro for those on a shoestring budget.
